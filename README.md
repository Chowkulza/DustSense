A home PM2.5 meter using the NodeMCU ESP8266.

**What This Code Does**
- Reads temperature & humidity from a DHT22 sensor.
- Reads PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 values from a PMS7003 air quality sensor.
- Displays readings on a 0.96-inch OLED screen.
- Sends data to Google Sheets via Wi-Fi (Google Apps Script is need).
  
**Project Purpose**

This project aims to transfer knowledge to young people in Thailand by utilizing IoT technology for indoor air quality monitoring.

The provided code is only an example that students can use as a guideline. It can be modified to suit their specific project requirements.

I have tried to provide detailed documentation to make the project easy to follow, even for those with no prior knowledge of programming or electronics. This project follows a probem-based learning approach, encouraging students and enthusiasts to explore problem-solving and seek knowledge from various sources as they develop their skills.
